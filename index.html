      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the heart of Silicon Valley; where warm sunny days are the norm, but winter rains are a welcome change. It's an amazingly diverse place where you can count on things always changing.  </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Becoming a web developer is a fun challenge for me. Web development is a ballance of independence and working together; of creativity and concreate thought; and a constant set of puzzles.  </p>
